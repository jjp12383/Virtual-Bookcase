This is a project that seeks to solve the problem that reading eBooks has brought about...how do you display what books you've read to house guests? For that matter, how do you lend out books when you don't have a physical copy?

Through the use of AngularJS, SVG assets, and CSS3 3D transforms, I've created a virtual bookcase that will display all of the books in your virtual library as classic leather-bound spines on a shelf. The intention is to run this app on a touchscreen monitor so that users can tap on a spine to 'open' the book they would like to read. Inside will be either an Amazon download link, or a QR code linking to your personal database for a direct ePub download (obviously, only non-copywritten material).

I have thusfar created the shelves and static spine graphics. Next step is to finish the opening animation and create a backend database to store eBook assets.
